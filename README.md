# Lego Fortnite AFK XP Macro

Recently, the developers at EPIC have made it so a user can no longer earn XP in Lego Fortnite if they're AFK. Previously, players had to sleep in a bed and enjoy the free XP. However, the recent update requires users to play the game to gain XP. This is where this Macro comes into play; it simulates a user playing the game by infinitely moving them for a random time.

## Pre-Requirements
Once the files have been installed, open a terminal within the directory and run the following command to install the pre-required packages to move the player and generate progress bars.
```bash
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```

## Usage/Examples
Once the required packages are installed and in-game, you can run the script in your terminal and click on the game to begin the process.

```bash
python main.py
```


## FAQ

#### It doesn't work while I'm trying to do other things!

Since this is a macro, you won't be able to do other things on your computer while the program is running. However, you can stop the program by stopping the script or closing the terminal.
